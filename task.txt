maintainable
5. Write a concise README
  a. How to run your code locally?
  b. A sample “curl” command to call your API
  c. How to run your unit tests locally?
  d. What do you love about your solution?

* Create a user model (id, daily_limit, created_at, updated_at)
* Create a task model (id, user_id, title, done, created_at, updated_at)
* Limitations
    - Task is only valid for current day. User will not be able to create task for future dates
    - We are not paginating dynamodb queries so max of 1mb of data will be received when getting the count of tasks for a given date.

POST /users/{userId}/tasks
